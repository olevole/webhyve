# webhyve
A web interface for (vm-)bhyve

----
Currently fairly messy code, using vm-bhyve as the base to grab info and control the VMs(!). 
----

TODO:

1. Fix vm listing to show stopped & started VMs. 

2. Refactor to get rid of the vm-bhyve dependency. 

3. Pull all the VMs into a SQL(ite) database. 

4. Creating/Deleting VMs, implementing the rest of this functionality.
